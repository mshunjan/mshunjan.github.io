 # Explaining JavaScript
 First of all lets dispel a common misconception. Javascript is not some offshoot of the Java programming languages, in fact it has almost nothing to do with it. Originally it was a marketing ploy to call it javascript, but just no that there is really no relation. Javascript is a versatile language. It runs on pretty much any device featuring a JS engine which reads your script, compiles it to machine code and executes it. What's great about JS is that its supported by pretty much every browser and therefore it is very popular, with lots of support.  

 # On datatypes
 Variables are dynamically typed, meaning variables aren't bound to a type like in C. Some cool things. For strings, you can also use backticks, but with backticks, if you add ${some code}, that code evaluates and becomes part of the string.
