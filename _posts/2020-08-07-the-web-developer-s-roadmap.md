# The road to knowing the web

So you wanna be a web dev. Well look no further than this tutorial on everything you need to know to becoming such a person. But why a web dev? Well just look at your life. Constantly browsing, ever connected, ever curious using the world wide web. The internet is powerful, and bending it to your will (that's an exaggeration), is one of the most powerful things you can do, especially in building your portfolio. Also, don't worry if you don't know anything, I'm going to go over anything you could possibly need to know, and then give you resources to look into the concepts yourself. Of course I will go over some basics but don't expect this to be completely comprehensive.

Before we go any further, I highly recommend taking a look at this excellent [roadmap] (https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) I found on github by @kamranahmedse(twitter handle), which summarizes a lot of what we will go over. This will give you an idea of what to expect! Don't let it scare you though, because it's unlikely you'll learn or use this all right away, or ever. Everything looks scary at first, but once you pull back the veil, all you're really left with is a sense of wonderment and excitation.

# Becoming a web dev - humble begginnings

Time and time again you will find that these core concepts are required to becomming a good web developer. Forget learning front end and back end for a second. Let's learn the basics first.

# The Setup
If you're interested in web development, it may not be too big of an assumption to think you have some interest or experience with computers. In your shenanigans, you may have even come across perhaps the greatest tool a developer in general has, the terminal. Now depending on your OS, you might have run into the Mac terminal (linux based), powershell or cmd (on Windows), or bash (linux). I myself use Windows, so I'll explain this setup, but here's [one](https://dev.to/v3frankie/setup-your-mac-for-development-2020-edition-1c8a) for macs.
