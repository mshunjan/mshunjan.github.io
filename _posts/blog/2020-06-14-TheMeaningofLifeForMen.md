I recently saw a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8)  by the famous psychologist Jordan Peterson regarding the above-mentioned title and thought about how it kind of touched upon my life. Take what you will from the video but for me, the key point was about how men seek responsibility, or rather, something of value to equate their worthiness. As a man, I tend to agree that I feel most fullfilled when I'm working on something, but as soon as the task is accomplished, there's a certian emptiness. When I reflect upon my past experiences, this has always rung true, especially when I've been doing home improvement. In that sense, I wonder if there is even any merit to equating your worthiness to the completion of a goal? 


Recently my family decided to repair our backyard deck, which was quite weathered. It is a painstaking process, from washing, sanding and finally staining the deck, including getting all the materials and tools for the job. The process was actually quite fun but as I neared its end, that feeling starting to creep up. What was the point? Yes we increased the property value, we used the backyard deck quite a lot so there's redecorative motivation, but beyond the material, did it really change anything?

After watching that video, some gears started turning in my head and I realized that I had been equating my worth to my ability to repair this deck. It was almost as if I couldn't stop working, unless I could do reach the goal. My mom will confirm this if no one believes me, but men in our family have this habit of working until the task is done. Through thirst and hunger, failure and other obstacles, we will stop for nothing. But now, I don't think this is a family trait, rather something men just tend to do.

I realize this is a little much, but I don't think it's too far-fetched to seek answers in life through philosophy and psychology. I seek to do what I cannot do. Yet what I cannot do, is what I can only do. Something like that. All in all, I think the solution to this vague emptiness is recognize value in what you do. I'm looking in way too deep in questioning what repairing my deck accomplished. Just look at it like "hey, new color on the deck". And if all else, just begin the next task.


BTW, I wanna apologize for the not so great writing on this first post. I hope to improve it soon!
