I've realized over the past year that I haven't been pulling my weight in the path I've been following to achieve my dreams. Sure I'm pursuing my university degree, with aspirations of higher education, but at the end of the day, I want to be my own boss. That entails learning a lot about the world, and really just gathering knowledge. So the goal of this website is to catalogue all the things that I learn. If you stumble upon this website, I hope you can learn something as well!
